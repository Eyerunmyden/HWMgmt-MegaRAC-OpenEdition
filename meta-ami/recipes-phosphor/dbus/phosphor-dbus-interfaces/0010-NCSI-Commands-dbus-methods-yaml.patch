+      returns:
+        - name: CompletionCode
+          type: byte
+          description: >

+    - name: SetVlanFilter
+      description: >
+         The Set VLAN Filter command is used by the Management Controller to program one or more VLAN IDs that are used for VLAN filtering.          Incoming packets that match both a VLAN ID filter and a MAC address filter are forwarded to the Management Controller. 
+         Other packets may be dropped based on the VLAN filtering mode per the Enable VLAN command.

+        - name: VlanID
+          type: uint16

+    - name: EnableVLAN
+      description: >
+          The Enable VLAN command may be used by the Management Controller to enable the channel to accept VLAN-tagged packets from the 
+          network for NC-SI Pass-through operation.
+      parameters:
+        - name: Mode
+          type: byte
+          description: >
+              The Mode field describes the modes for VLAN eg:- 
+              1) VLAN only :- Only VLAN-tagged packets that match the enabled VLAN Filter settings (and also match the MAC Address Filtering                              configuration) are accepted. Non-VLAN-tagged packets are not accepted.
+
+              2) VLAN + non-VLAN :- VLAN-tagged packets that match the enabled VLAN Filter setting (and also match the MAC Address Filtering                                    configuration) are accepted. 
+
+              3) Any VLAN + non-VLAN :- Any VLAN-tagged packets that also match the MAC Address Filtering configuration are accepted, 
+                                        regardless of the VLAN Filter settings. Non-VLAN-tagged packets are also accepted.
