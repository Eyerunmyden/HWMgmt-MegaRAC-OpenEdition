Subject: [PATCH] Change Severity for ServiceFailure redfish event

During Ac cycle stress, at times some services may exit unsuccessfully.
This will not have any functionality impact. So updated Severity of
"ServiceFailure" redfish event to "Ok".

Tested:
1. Redfish validator - passed for this with change
2. Killed couple of process and observed Redfish EventLog shows updated
   Severity.
Redfish URI:
GET: https://<BMC IP>/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/EventLog
            /Entries
        {
            "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/system/LogServices/
                          EventLog/Entries/1606938922",
            "@odata.type": "#LogEntry.v1_4_0.LogEntry",
            "Created": "2020-12-02T19:55:22+00:00",
            "EntryType": "Event",
            "Id": "1606938922",
            "Message": "Service phosphor-ipmi-host.service has exited
                        unsuccessfully.",
            "MessageArgs": [
                "phosphor-ipmi-host.service"
            ],
            "MessageId": "OpenBMC.0.1.ServiceFailure",
            "Name": "System Event Log Entry",
            "Severity": "OK"
        }
