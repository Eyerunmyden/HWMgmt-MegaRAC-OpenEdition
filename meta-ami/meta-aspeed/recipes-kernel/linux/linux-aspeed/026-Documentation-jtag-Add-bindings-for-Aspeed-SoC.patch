Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: jtag: Add bindings for Aspeed SoC

It has been tested on Mellanox system with BMC equipped with
Aspeed 2520 SoC for programming CPLD devices.

It also has been tested on Intel systems with BMC equipped with
Aspeed 25x0 SoC for JTAG board communication.

+Aspeed JTAG driver for ast2400 and ast2500 SoC
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible:		Should be one of
+      - "aspeed,ast2400-jtag"
+      - "aspeed,ast2500-jtag"
+- reg			contains the offset and length of the JTAG memory
+			region
+- clocks		root clock of bus, should reference the APB
+			clock in the second cell
+- resets		phandle to reset controller with the reset number in
+			the second cell
+- interrupts		should contain JTAG controller interrupt
+
+Example:
+jtag: jtag@1e6e4000 {
+	compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-jtag";
+	reg = <0x1e6e4000 0x1c>;
+	clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_APB>;
+	resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_JTAG_MASTER>;
+	interrupts = <43>;
+};
