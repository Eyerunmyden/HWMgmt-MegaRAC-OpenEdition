Subject: [PATCH] power-control: Fix power cycle issue

In power cycle, the expected power actions is power off then power on.
In the current code of redfish core, the power sequence is soft power
off then power off then power on.
This commit remove soft power off step.

Tested:
	1. Trigger "power cycle" action in Redfish.
	2. The power sequence should be power off then power on.
